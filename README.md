# Coverage Workshop

This is a workshop run by the HPA group as part of the OpenLab series.

The code can either be run locally by cloning it yourself (make sure to install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and that you have jupyter labs properly built), or you may find it hosted online at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wtsi-hpag/CoverageWorkshop/HEAD?labpath=Workshop.ipynb.
